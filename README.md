Goonch is a project with the end goal of yielding dating site conversation data analytics.
A completed V1 will auto-swipe through tinder, accumulating matches, and then spawn off a chatbot instance for the first one.
It will then log the conversation into a database to be used for training data (for the next iteration).

Goonch was written with extensibility in mind.
Future directions will include:
- Graphical management.
- A db migration to postgresql to enable scalability (currently prototyped in SQLITE3).
- Cloud deployment to AWS.
